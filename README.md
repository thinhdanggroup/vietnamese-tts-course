# Vietnamese TTS Course

An end-to-end learning guide for Vietnamese Text-to-Speech systems — from audio fundamentals to production deployment.

This course is built around the **[VieNeu-TTS](https://github.com/pnnbao97/VieNeu-TTS)** model and covers the full pipeline: how audio works, how Vietnamese text is processed, how modern neural TTS models are designed, and how to fine-tune and deploy your own Vietnamese voice.

---

## Who Is This For?

ML practitioners who know the basics (training loops, loss functions, backpropagation) but are new to **audio processing** and **TTS systems**. All examples use Vietnamese language data.

| [10](chapters/chapter-10.md) | Deployment & Optimization | GGUF quantization, streaming, voices.json, RTF benchmark |

Each chapter has:
- A **theory file** (`.md`) — deep explanation with full math derivations
- A **hands-on notebook** (`.ipynb`) — runnable code with Vietnamese examples

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Basic ML knowledge: training loops, loss, gradient descent
- [VieNeu-TTS](https://github.com/pnnbao97/VieNeu-TTS) cloned and dependencies installed (`uv sync`)

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone VieNeu-TTS (provides the models and example audio)
git clone https://github.com/pnnbao97/VieNeu-TTS.git
cd VieNeu-TTS
uv sync

# Clone this course into the learning/ folder
git clone https://github.com/thinhdanggroup/vietnamese-tts-course.git learning

# Launch notebooks
uv run jupyter lab learning/chapters/
```

Or read the theory files directly — each `.md` is self-contained.

---

## Running on Google Colab

You can open any chapter notebook directly in Colab:

```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/thinhdanggroup/vietnamese-tts-course/blob/main/chapters/chapter-01.ipynb
```

Replace `chapter-01` with the chapter you want (e.g. `chapter-03`, `chapter-07`).

**Before running any cells**, paste and run this setup cell at the top of the notebook:

```python
# ── Colab Setup ──────────────────────────────────────────────
import os

# Clone VieNeu-TTS (provides example audio at examples/audio_ref/)
if not os.path.exists('/content/VieNeu-TTS'):
    !git clone https://github.com/pnnbao97/VieNeu-TTS.git /content/VieNeu-TTS

# Clone this course into the learning/ subfolder
if not os.path.exists('/content/VieNeu-TTS/learning'):
    !git clone https://github.com/thinhdanggroup/vietnamese-tts-course.git /content/VieNeu-TTS/learning

# Install notebook dependencies
!pip install -q librosa soundfile matplotlib

# Change to chapters/ so relative paths (../examples/...) resolve correctly
os.chdir('/content/VieNeu-TTS/learning/chapters')
print("Setup complete. Current dir:", os.getcwd())
```

> **Why clone VieNeu-TTS?** The notebooks load audio from `../examples/audio_ref/example.wav`, which lives inside the VieNeu-TTS repository. The setup above recreates the same directory structure that the local setup uses.

**Runtime recommendation:**
- Chapters 01–04 (signal processing, architectures, codecs): CPU is fine
- Chapters 05–10 (model inference, fine-tuning, deployment): use a **GPU runtime** (`Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU`)

---

## Vietnamese Focus

- All audio examples use Vietnamese speech
- Text examples cover all **6 tones**: ngang (a), huyền (à), sắc (á), hỏi (ả), ngã (ã), nặng (ạ)
- Code-switching (Vietnamese + English) covered in Chapters 2 and 6
- Regional dialect differences (Bắc / Trung / Nam) discussed in Chapters 2 and 8
